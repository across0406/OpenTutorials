                        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
                        dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted
                        programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three
                        core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make
                        webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The
                        majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without
                        the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many
                        JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based
                        on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec
                        fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
